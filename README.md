# Classification Portfolio

Welcome to my Classification Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of classification projects that demonstrate my skills in machine learning classification techniques. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast, potential collaborator, or prospective employer, I hope you find these projects insightful and engaging.

## Projects
<!--
### 1. Spam Email Detection
- **Description**: Implemented a spam email detection system using a combination of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Achieved an accuracy of 95% on a benchmark dataset.
- **Technologies**: Python, scikit-learn, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction
- **Description**: Developed a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn from a telecom company. Explored various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to achieve the best performance.
- **Technologies**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas

### 3. Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Description**: Built a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs with over 90% accuracy. Explored different architectures, data augmentation techniques, and transfer learning strategies.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Computer Vision
